Currently, the tool is pretty straightforward to use if you already know how the json system works, I'd suggest you check out https://www.zbx1425.cn/nautilus/mtr-nte/#/display.md

It is made entirely in Python, therefore you need to have Python installed to use this tool.

As of typing this, it is very incomplete and for now you can only create a new display, create new stations & routes. More features to automate the process will be added along the way (and if they already are, yay!). Please keep in mind that this tool is mostly for people who already know how the json system works, to easily manage their displays, it is not a tool intended for beginners, although there will be one coming soon!
